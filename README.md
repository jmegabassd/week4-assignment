# Reflection

# ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?

> Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected. YES
> 
> Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either Responsive Design or media queries. YES
> 
> Create a working GET API route in your server. YES
> 
> Create a working POST API route in your client. YES
> 
> Seed your database with realistic-looking â€˜dummyâ€™ data. YES

> ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

> I wanted to create a like button and share button but ran out of time.
> I wanted to make a button to expand text that the user had left, made a start with chaning the comment to a paragraph, the plan was to show one line only then have a buttton to read more but again ran out of time.

# Optional

> Tha main issue I had was with @Media, it works in portait mode but landscape breaks the page. I now realise after inspecting the page with dev tools that on landscape grid is altered and changes orientation, I couldn't figure out how to make it retain the original orientation. If this is the case, either another massive @ media is needed which seems overkill or I need to make the page using less grid. I'm not sure....
